The most satisfying part of this project was when I finally came up with a solution for the player sprite. After hours of struggling trying to get the bitmap to change without leaving useless bitmaps on the screen I decided to flip through my notes to see if there was anything I could use in there for inspiration. A few of my notes pertained to using SWC files, and I decided that may be easier. With the help of forums, learning the proper MovieClip commands, I had a seamlessly animated player sprite.

Least satisfying was when I first started working with the project. For some reason I thought we were suppose to use the Display directory as the Resources directory. After reading the instructions for the fifth time it clicked. I put the code into the Resources and it still wasn't working. I had typed up the file code instead of right clicking on the PNGs and choosing Embed. The whole first step was unsatisfying and felt like I was stumbling around. After all that the enemy sprites were using the proper bitmaps.

I learned a good deal about using the proper .as directory, loading up bitmaps, and incorporating Flash animations. I also gained a better understanding of the export, save, and publish actions in Flash. Since the images early one where saved as .bmps, the alpha layer appeared as white, that feels like a failure. I would have to go back through, cut out the white backgrounds, save as .pngs, and reapply into FlashDevelop before releasing the game.
