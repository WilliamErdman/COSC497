The most satisfying part of this project was the complete game portion, when there were randomly appearing squares and dots to click on, and a penalty for missing a click. The least satisfying was having a working score tracker on the screen, it took much longer to work out and was more complicated then I had previously imagined. Adding it was more difficult then I had anticipated from my experience in previous game projects.

I learned a little more about the nuances of programming with Flash. Learning how the game updates and reads certain sections of code, especially the number of children. Learning how to use the vector squares and get them to grow from the center was fast and oddly satisfying. I got the score subtraction to work, but I feel it is broken. I was unable to successfully implement it in Main.as, but was able to implement it successfully in multiple ways in Dot.as. So I decided to keep the code there, despite the amount it subtracted growing with each spawned dot. In the end it adds another level of complexity as the game goes on, punishing more for missed clicks later in the game.
