Assignment 3
William A. Erdman

	My first major mistake on this project was taking my time with it. Tuesday I managed to incorporate all the button push commands in the flow chart I designed for the engine. I also made it easy to change the flow and values in the input if I find it necessary. I figured that with the help of Google and the Adobe Flash Platform guide that it wouldn't be a problem to incorporate the mouse buttons.  I took time out each day to try and tackle the problem. It wasn't till Friday that I really buckled down for the project, by the time I was at my wits end it was too late to e-mail anyone and couldn't find any helpful guides or how-tos.

	Important lesson here; allow myself more time to seek help if I can't figure it out myself. I was proud that I was able to dissect the rest of the code and make it work. I found it helped me to go through the code, wright it out myself, and heavily comment it.
